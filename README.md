# ValiPop

_ValiPop_ is a micro-simulation model for generating synthetic genealogical populations
from a set of desired statistics. _ValiPop_ also verifies that the 
desired properties exist in the generated populations. It is reasonably scalable and 
customisable, and able to create populations for a wide range of purposes.  The focus 
of our research is the use of multiple synthetic genealogical populations to evaluate and 
improve data linkage algorithms.

_ValiPop_'s micro-simulation model is written in Java. The supporting verification analysis 
and statistical code is written in R.

## Running ValiPop

### Via Java

To run ValiPop from the release JAR file, the following need to be installed:

## Building ValiPop from source

To build ValiPop, the following need to be installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Java 21 or higher
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

To build ValiPop:

```shell
